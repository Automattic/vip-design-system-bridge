/**
 * Hi there, VIP dev!
 *
 * vip-config.php is where you put things you'd usually put in wp-config.php. Don't worry about database settings
 * and such, we've taken care of that for you. This is a good place to define a constant or something of that
 * nature. However, consider using environment variables for anything sensitive or environment-specific:
 *
 * @see https://docs.wpvip.com/how-tos/manage-environment-variables/
 *
 * WARNING: This file is loaded very early (immediately after `wp-config.php`), which means that most WordPress APIs,
 *   classes, and functions are not available. The code below should be limited to pure PHP.
 *
 * @see https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/vip-config-directory/
 *
 * Happy coding!
 *
 * - The WordPress VIP Team
