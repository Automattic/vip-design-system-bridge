# DOCUMENTATION

This is where all the documentation around how this script is to be used resides. There are 3 parts to this script:

* Exporting data from your design system so the script can understand it.
* Using the script to insert that data into the `theme.json` of a WordPress site.
* Using the data that's been inserted into the `theme.json`, in the Editor.

## Exporting Data from your Design System

This section is devoted to understanding how you can export your design system data, for the script to undestand it.

### Figma

At the moment we support only Figma, so this is what this section focuses on.

## Using the Script

This section is devoted to understanding how you can ingest the exported data using the script, so it's inserted into your `theme.json`.
